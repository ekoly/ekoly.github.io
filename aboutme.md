My name is Erik Cowley. This site contains my portfolio from my time as a Data Science student at Lambda school.

The website name "stromsy" is derived from "Straumsey" or "stormy seas", which was the name of an island explored by Lief Erikson. It is mentioned in [The Saga of Erik the Red](https://sagadb.org/eiriks_saga_rauda.en).
