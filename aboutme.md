My name is Erik Cowley. This site is my data science portfolio.

I am currently enrolled in [Lambda School for Data Science](https://lambdaschool.com/courses/data-science). My previous professional experience includes Python backend development and frontend development with knockout.js. ([My resume in pdf form](https://stromsy.nfshost.com/content/erik-cowley-resume-12-3-2019.pdf)).

The website name "stromsy" is derived from "Straumsey" or "stormy seas", which was the name of an island discovered by Lief Erikson. It is mentioned in [The Saga of Erik the Red](https://sagadb.org/eiriks_saga_rauda.en).
