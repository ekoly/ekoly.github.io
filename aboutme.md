My name is Erik Cowley. This site contains my portfolio from my time as a Data Science student at Lambda school.

"Stromsy" comes from "Straumsey" or "stormy seas", which was the name of an island explored by Lief Erikson. It is mentioned in [The Saga of Erik the Red](https://sagadb.org/eiriks_saga_rauda.en).
