The goal of this project was to identify interesting trends in MMA by exploring publicly available UFC data.

## Research Question
For each of a few countries with high UFC participation, plot the proportion of wins to total number of fights by year. "Wins" are further broken down into Decisions, TKOs, and Submissions.

## Which countries have high UFC participation?

The first part of our question requires us to find countries with high UFC participation. There are potentially several ways to do this:

1. Countries with the highest total number of fighters
2. Countries with the highest per capita number of fighters
