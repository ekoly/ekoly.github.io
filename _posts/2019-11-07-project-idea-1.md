# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?


What do you know about?


What decisions do you face?


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

participation in combat sports in the general population vs number of high-ranked professional fighters

2. Trend related to the news


3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about

domestic violence vs participation in combat sports in the general population

5. Valuable to businesses

which areas of business that advertise with the UFC get the highest customer conversion rate

6. What's the most popular?

predictive model of which low-ranking UFC fighters are likely to become successful

7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

People sometimes assume that people who participate in combat sports are violent people. While it is true 
that some fighters have gotten in trouble for violent behavior (such as the recent incident in which Conor McGregor
hit an old man), my own belief is that combat sports can provide a healthy outlet for aggressive tendencies and 
do not **cause** violent behavior. I would be interested in investigating this further.
