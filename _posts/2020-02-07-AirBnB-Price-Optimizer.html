<h1> AirPrice - AirBnB Price Optimization </h1>

<p>
  The app is live at <a href="https://airprice.now.sh/">https://airprice.now.sh/</a>. The app was a team effort,
  see <a href="https://rg-optimalpricer.netlify.com/about.html">this page</a> for the team members and roles.
  The source of the data science portion of the app <a href="https://github.com/build-week-optimal-pricing/Data-science">can be seen here</a>.

<h3> What is it for? </h3>

<p>
  Many people who have AirBnB listings set the price either too low or too high. If the price is too low
  then the room will always be filled, but they aren't getting as much money as they could from the listing.
  If the price is too high, the room will not be filled most of the time and the profits will not be optimal.
  Our goal was to suggest an optimal price at which the listing can be filled most of the time.
